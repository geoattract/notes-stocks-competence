As a Forensic Value Analyst specializing in the **Li Lu (Himalaya Capital)** framework, I have scrutinized **Depo Auto Parts Industrial (TPE: 6605)**. This analysis ignores market sentiment and focuses strictly on the "Owner's Earnings" capacity, the durability of the moat, and the margin of safety relative to a conservative "floor" valuation.

---

## STEP 1: PRE-QUALIFICATION (THE "TOO HARD" PILE)

* **Business Simplicity:** **YES.** Depo manufactures and sells automotive lighting (headlights/tail lights) for the Aftermarket (AM) and OEM segments. The unit economics—molds, production volume, and global distribution—are straightforward.
* **Historical Profitability:** **YES.** Depo has remained FCF positive in all of the last 5 years (2020–2024). Even during the 2021 shipping crisis, the core engine remained cash-generative.
* **Circle of Competence:** **YES.** This is a physical goods business with trackable manufacturing margins and replacement-cycle demand.
* **Verdict:** **PASS.** Proceed to deep-dive.

---

## STEP 2: THE MOAT & VIABILITY

* **The "10% Test" (Pricing Power):** **EXPANDING.** * Gross Margins: 24.2% (2020)  27.4% (2021)  29.6% (2022)  31.7% (2023)  **34.1% (2024)**.
* The 1,000bps expansion in 5 years during inflationary periods confirms significant pricing power and scale efficiency.


* **Switching Cost Evidence:** **HIGH (Tooling/Molds).** In the AM segment, the "moat" is the library of proprietary molds. A competitor must spend millions to replicate the tooling for a single car model (e.g., a 2018 Toyota Camry). Depo’s massive catalog creates a "Data & Physical Lock-in" for global distributors.
* **Disruption Risk:** **LOW.** While EVs change powertrains, they still require high-visibility lighting. Depo is actually benefiting from the transition to higher-ASP (Average Selling Price) LED and Matrix lighting technologies.

---

## STEP 3: FINANCIAL FORTRESS

* **Solvency (D/E Ratio):** * Current: **0.25** * 5-Year Avg: **0.34**
* *Math:* . (Target: ). **PASS.**


* **Cash Conversion:**
* *Math:* . (Target: ). **PASS.**


* **The "Zero-Revenue" Survival:**
* *Math:* . Annual OpEx (SG&A + R&D)  3.0B TWD.
* **Result:** **16.4 Months.** The company can survive over a year with zero sales. **PASS.**



---

## STEP 4: MANAGEMENT & INTEGRITY

* **Capital Allocation:** Primarily **(A) Dividends** and **(B) Debt Reduction**. Management has reduced total debt from 8.5B (2023) to 7.4B (2024) while maintaining a 6%+ dividend yield.
* **Share Count Trend:** **STABLE.** Total shares have remained fixed at **165.82M** for 4+ years. CAGR = 0%. **PASS.**
* **Compensation Alignment:** CEO Hsu Hsu-ming (founder) remains the primary visionary. Compensation is historically tied to "Employees' and Directors' Profit Sharing" (approx. 2-5% of pre-tax profit), aligning them directly with bottom-line performance.

---

## STEP 5: THE DUAL-VALUATION ENGINE

### A. The Li Lu Ratio (ROTIC)



* **EBIT (TTM):** 3.41B
* **Total Assets:** 32.97B
* **Cash:** 4.09B
* **Goodwill:** ~0
* **NIBCL (Current Liab - ST Debt):** 
* **Result:**  (Target: ). **PASS.**

### B. Calculation 1: Strict Valuation (3-Year Conservative)

* **Strict EBIT ():** (3.9 + 2.9 + 2.2) / 3 = **3.00B TWD**
* **Multiple ():** **15x** (Reflecting expanding gross margins and high ROTIC).
* **Intrinsic Value:** 
* **Strict Valuation Gap:** 

### C. Calculation 2: Normalized Valuation (Current Power)

* **Normalized EBIT ():** **3.41B TWD** (TTM)
* **Intrinsic Value:** 
* **Normalized Valuation Gap:** 

---

## STEP 6: THE RED FLAG GAUNTLET (AUTO-AVOID)

* **Declining ROIC:** No. (ROIC is trending upward with margins).
* **Acquisition Spree:** No. (Growth is organic).
* **Capital Intensity:** No. ( of OCF).
* **Insider Activity:** No. (Main holdings remain with the Hsu family/Jian Song Investment).

## FINAL REPORT OUTPUT

| **Ticker** | **Verdict** |
| --- | --- |
| **TPE: 6605** | **BUY** |

### Summary Table:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Current Market Cap** | 23.71B TWD |
| **Strict Intrinsic Value** | 44.30B TWD |
| **Strict Valuation Gap** | **46.5% Undervalued** |
| **Normalized Valuation Gap** | **53.0% Undervalued** |

### The "Anti-Thesis":

A smart person would **SELL** if they believe the current margin expansion is a temporary "post-pandemic" fluke and that rising LED/smart-light R&D costs will eventually compress operating margins below 10%. Furthermore, litigation risks from OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) trying to block AM (Aftermarket) parts in certain jurisdictions could impair the long-term value of the mold library.

### The "Fat Pitch" Condition:

Depo is currently a "Fat Pitch." At the current price of **143 TWD**, the Strict Valuation Gap is already **46.5%**. Even with a more conservative 12x multiple, the gap remains >30%.

# Strict Li Lu Analysis Framework for **Depo Auto Parts Industrial Co., Ltd.** *(TPE:6605)*  

**Analysis Date:** December 22 2025  
**Data Sources:** GuruFocus, Investing.com, TSEC Filings, FT Markets  

---  

## SECTION 1 – BUSINESS MOAT & COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE  

### Core Business (One Sentence)  
Depo Auto Parts manufactures and distributes aftermarket (AM) and original‑equipment (OE) automotive lighting systems globally.  

### Durable Competitive Advantage – **STRICT TEST**  

| Test | Result | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **PASS** – Library & Distribution** | ✅ | > 10,000 tooling molds + global distribution network → high barrier to entry. |
| **Pricing Power** | ✅ | Gross margins > 30 % (currently **31.89 %**) despite inflation → can pass costs to a fragmented aftermarket. |
| **Moat Trend** | **STABLE** | Scale unmatched, but OEM patent litigation (e.g., Mercedes‑Benz) pressures the “Repair Clause”. |

---  

## SECTION 2 – BUSINESS QUALITY & PREDICTABILITY  

- **Forecastability 10 yr out?** ✅ – Headlights are mandatory safety components; demand driven by vehicle‑parc age & collision rates, not fashion.  
- **Revenue Nature** – *Transactional* (not subscription) but “pseudo‑recurring” due to wear‑and‑tear and accidents.  
- **Cyclicality** – *Counter‑cyclical*: recessions → older cars kept longer → higher AM parts demand.  
- **Forecast Confidence** – ✅ – 10‑yr CAGR ≈ 3 % with highly predictable cash‑flow generation.  

---  

## SECTION 3 – FINANCIAL FORTRESS  

| Metric | Value | Benchmark / Comment |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Debt‑to‑Equity** | **0.25** vs. industry 0.64 (Investing.com) | **PASS** – well below 0.5; down from 0.86 in 2020. |
| **Free‑Cash‑Flow (FCF)** | Positive ≥ 10 yr | ✅ |
| **Cash‑Conversion (FCF/NI)** | **106 %** (2024: $ \text{FCF}=3.35\text{B},\; \text{NI}=3.15\text{B}$) | **PASS** |
| **Survival Test** | Current ratio 1.31; cash TWD 3.4 B | ✅ – can cover interest & ops even with a major revenue hit. |

| **Market Cap** | 23,712 M |
| **P/E Ratio** | 9.92× (5‑yr avg 13.5×) |
| **ROIC (TTM)** | 11.9 % vs. Cost of Capital ≈ 8 % |
| **ROTIC (Li Lu Ratio)** | $ \displaystyle \frac{3,916}{32,977 - 3,383 - 0 - 6,100} \approx 16.6\% $ (Target > 15 % → **PASS**) |

### A. Strict Valuation (3‑Year Conservative)

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Strict EBIT}_{\text{strict}} &= \frac{3,915 + 2,930 + 2,163}{3} = 3,003 \\
M &= 12\text{x (legal‑risk adjusted)} \\

\text{Valuation Gap} &= 1 - \frac{23,712}{34,608} = \mathbf{31.5\%}
\end{aligned}
\]

### B. Normalized Valuation (Current Power)

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{EBIT}_{\text{norm}} &= 3,916 \\
\text{Intrinsic Value} &= (3,916 \times 12) + (3,383 - 4,811) = \mathbf{45,564} \\

| Poor capital allocation | **NO** |
| Management integrity issues | **NO** |
| **Active material lawsuits / regulatory investigations** | **YES** (Mercedes‑Benz patent case) |
| Margin of safety < 20 % | **NO** |

---  

## FINAL REPORT OUTPUT  

| Ticker | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| **TPE:6605** | **AVOID** |

### Summary Table – Strict vs. Normalized Valuation Gap  

| Metric | Strict Valuation | Normalized Valuation | Difference |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **EBIT Used** | 3,003 M | 3,916 M | 913 M |
| **Quality Multiple** | 12× | 12× | — |
| **Intrinsic Value** | 34,608 M | 45,564 M | 10,956 M |
| **Market Cap** | 23,712 M | 23,712 M | — |
| **Valuation Gap** | 31.5 % | 47.9 % | 16.4 % |
| **Verdict** | **BUY** | **BUY** | **CONTRADICTION** |

### FINAL VERDICT  

**Is this a Li Lu‑style value buy? – NO.**  

Although the company shows strong financial health, a sizable margin of safety (31 %+), and a solid moat, the framework forces an **AVOID** because of the material, unresolved Mercedes‑Benz patent litigation. Under the “Zero Ambiguity” Li Lu approach, any threat to the “Repair Clause” and the right to manufacture aftermarket parts is a terminal risk until legally resolved.  

---  

## INVESTMENT THESIS  

Depo is a high‑quality, cash‑generative industrial compounder trading at a **> 30 % discount** to its earnings power. The existential OEM design‑patent litigation, however, creates a **fat‑tail** risk that outweighs the attractive valuation.  

### Moat Assessment  

| Aspect | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| **Type** | Economies of scale & distribution depth |
| **Durability** | Strong (financial) / Weak (legal) |
| **Trend** | Narrowing (legal challenges) |
| **Risk/Reward** | Upside + 100 % (re‑rating to 15× P/E) vs. downside ‑ 50 % (injunctions) → **2:1** (fails 3:1 target) |

### ACTION  

**AVOID** – Material legal litigation on core product patents triggers an automatic avoid under the strict Li Lu framework.
