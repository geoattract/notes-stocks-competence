# DATAROMA CONTRARIAN PLAY STRATEGY
## Finding Hidden Multibagger Opportunities from Superinvestor Holdings

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This strategy focuses on identifying **undervalued, lesser-known stocks** held by elite superinvestors that have **high multibagger potential** but are NOT yet consensus picks. The goal is to find stocks before they become mainstream.

---

## CORE CONTRARIAN PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Avoid Consensus Plays**
- **Skip:** MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META, V, MA (too crowded, limited upside)
- **Why:** Already priced in by the market; limited multibagger potential

### 2. **Hunt for Conviction Plays**
- Stocks held by **only 1-3 superinvestors** (less crowded)
- Stocks that are **concentrated positions** (high % of portfolio)
- Stocks held by **proven multibagger hunters** (Bill Ackman, Daniel Loeb, David Abrams)

### 3. **Look for Emerging Themes**
- Stocks appearing in **recent activity** (Q3 2025 buys)
- Stocks with **new positions** being added
- Stocks in **undervalued sectors** (value plays, turnarounds)
