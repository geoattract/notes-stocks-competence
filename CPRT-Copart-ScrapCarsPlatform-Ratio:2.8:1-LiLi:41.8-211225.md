# Strict Li Lu Analysis Framework: Copart, Inc. [CPRT]

**OBJECTIVE:** Provide a definitive YES/NO/AVOID verdict based on the Li Lu value investing framework.

**DATA SOURCE:** Financials extracted from GuruFocus (Dec 2025), SEC 10-K (FY ended July 31, 2024), and 10-Q (Oct 31, 2024).

---

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS MOAT & COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### Core Business (One Sentence)

* Copart provides online auction and vehicle remarketing services for salvage and used vehicles, primarily for insurance companies.

### Durable Competitive Advantage - STRICT TEST

* **PASS:** Copart possesses a massive two-sided network effect (global buyer base + insurance supply) and a physical "moat" through its extensive ownership of licensed salvage land, which faces extreme zoning hurdles for new entrants.
* Does the company have pricing power? **YES.** It has consistently raised service fees and maintained margins despite competitive pressures.
* Is this moat widening, stable, or narrowing? **WIDENING.** Copart has steadily gained market share from its primary competitor, IAA (now RB Global), due to its superior technology and logistics network.

---

## SECTION 2: BUSINESS QUALITY & PREDICTABILITY

* Is the business model simple enough to forecast 10 years out? **YES.** Total loss rates and vehicle volumes are historically stable and predictable.
* Are revenues recurring or transactional? **TRANSACTIONAL** (but highly recurring due to the nature of insurance industry contracts).
* Cyclical or counter-cyclical? **COUNTER-CYCLICAL.** During recessions, demand for salvage parts and used cars typically increases as new car sales slow.
* **CRITICAL:** Can you forecast earnings 5-10 years with 80%+ confidence? **YES.**

---

## SECTION 3: FINANCIAL FORTRESS

* **Debt-to-Equity ratio:** **0.01** vs. industry average: **0.65** (Source: GuruFocus/Alpha Spread).
* **PASS:** D/E < 0.5 and stable/declining.
* Free Cash Flow positive? **YES.** Growing faster than earnings? **YES.** (FY2024 FCF ~$1.5B vs NI $1.36B).
* **Cash conversion rate (FCF/Net Income):** **110.3%** (Target: >80%).
* Can survive 50% revenue drop for 2 years? **YES.** With ~$3.7B in cash and virtually no debt, the company is a "fortress."

---

## SECTION 4: MANAGEMENT & INTEGRITY DUE DILIGENCE

### Management Team Assessment

* **CEO tenure:** Jeffrey Liaw (joined 2016, CEO since 2022). **Track record:** Exceptional; led international expansion and tech modernization.
* **Management changes (last 5 years):** Transition of Jay Adair to Executive Chairman; Leah Stearns appointed CFO. No suspicious departures.
* **Red flag:** Frequent C-suite turnover? **NO.**

### Integrity Check

* **SEC filings:** No restatements or auditor disputes reported in 2024 10-K. **YES.**
* **Insider trading:** Net **SELLING**. Key insiders (Adair, Liaw) have sold shares in late 2024/2025. This indicates a "caution" signal regarding price, though they retain massive holdings.
* **Management compensation:** Tied to performance-based equity and operating income targets.
* **Related-party transactions:** None that are suspicious. **NO.**

### Lawsuits & Legal Risk

* **Active lawsuits:** Standard operational litigation (contract disputes, property damage). No material litigation disclosed in latest 10-K Note 14.
* **Regulatory risk:** Subject to environmental and zoning regulations; no active federal investigations. **NO.**
* **Settlement history:** No major settlements exceeding 1% of revenue in the past 5 years.
* **Verdict:** Does legal risk threaten the business model? **NO.**

## SECTION 5: MARKET POSITION & SUSTAINABILITY

### Market Share & Competitive Position

* **Market share:** **~45%** (vs. top 3 competitors: RB Global/IAA ~35%, smaller regional players ~20%).

* **Market size (TAM):** ~$25B global salvage market. **Penetration:** ~17%.
* **Growth runway:** **YES.** International expansion (Germany, Spain, Brazil) provides a long runway.

### 10-Year Viability Test

* **Disruption risk:** Is the business threatened? **NO.** EV accidents result in higher total-loss rates due to battery costs, potentially benefiting Copart.
* **Customer concentration:** Top 10 customers < 30% of revenue. No single insurer poses an existential threat.
* **Supplier concentration:** Dependent on single supplier? **NO.**
* **Verdict:** Will this company exist and thrive in 10 years? **YES.**

## FINAL VERDICT

**Is this a Li Lu-style value buy?**

### **NO**

(Condition Failed: Reasonable valuation / Margin of Safety).

### **AVOID**

(Reason: **Margin of safety < 20%**. While Copart is a world-class "business quality" play, it fails the "value" requirement of the Li Lu framework at current prices).

---

## INVESTMENT THESIS

Copart is a high-quality compounder with a dominant moat, exceptional ROIC (41.8% Li Lu Ratio), and a debt-free balance sheet. However, the current market price of ~$39 implies a significant premium over its intrinsic value of ~$28, providing no margin of safety for a value investor.

---

## MOAT ASSESSMENT

* **Type:** Network Effects & Scale/Zoning Cost Advantage.
* **Durability:** **Strong**
* **Trend:** **Widening**
* **Evidence:** Operating margins of 37% and ROIC >30% sustained over a decade.

---

## RISK/REWARD

* **Upside (5-10 years):** **~100%** (Projected earnings growth of 12% CAGR).
* **Downside (if thesis breaks):** **~35%** (Reversion to intrinsic value of $28).
* **Ratio:** **2.8:1** (Close to target but hindered by entry price).

---

## ACTION

**AVOID**
The business is magnificent, but the price is prohibitive; wait for a correction to <$30 to achieve a sufficient margin of safety.
