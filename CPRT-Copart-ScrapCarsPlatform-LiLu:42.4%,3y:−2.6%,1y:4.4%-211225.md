# Forensic Analysis of Copart, Inc. (CPRT)

This forensic analysis evaluates **Copart, Inc. (CPRT)** through the lens of the Li Lu (Himalaya Capital) methodology, prioritizing the search for reasons to **REJECT** the investment. Data is based on TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) ending October 31, 2025, and the 2025 Annual 10-K report.

---

## STEP 1: PRE-QUALIFICATION (THE "TOO HARD" PILE)

| Criterion | Assessment | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Business Simplicity** | Copart acts as a global digital auction house for salvage vehicles (mostly from insurance companies). Revenue is earned via per-unit auction fees and ancillary services (towing/storage). | **YES** |
| **Historical Profitability** | FCF has been positive for 5+ consecutive years ($1.26B in FY2025). | **YES** |
| **Circle of Competence** | Physical yard network (10,000+ acres) and digital auction platform with clear unit economics. | **YES** |

**VERDICT: PROCEED TO ANALYSIS**

---

## STEP 2: THE MOAT & VIABILITY

### The "10% Test" (Pricing Power)

* **FY2025 Gross Margin:** 45.3%
* **5-Year Trend:** Stable/Expanding (from ~43% in 2020 to ~45% in 2025).
* **Verdict:** **EXPANDING**. High evidence of pricing power despite rising yard operational costs.

### Switching Cost Evidence

The friction point is a **Network Effect + Operational Integration**. Insurance companies are deeply integrated into Copart's logistics (CAS system), and the global buyer pool (200+ countries) ensures the highest salvage value, making it "psychologically and financially prohibitive" for a seller to leave the largest liquidity pool.

### Disruption Risk

**#1 Threat:** **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) & Autonomous Vehicles.**  
If accidents decrease by >50% in the next decade, the volume engine dies. However, current data shows that higher complexity in cars leads to higher "Total Loss" rates (repairs are too expensive), which offsets the lower frequency of accidents.

* **Verdict:** **PASS** (Threat is long-term, not imminent <10 years).

---

## STEP 3: FINANCIAL FORTRESS

### Solvency (Debt/Equity)

* **Current Debt:** $103.7M (Leases/Notes) / **Equity:** $9,187M  
* **Ratio:** $103.7 / 9,187 = **0.01**  
* **5-Year Average:** < 0.10. (Target: < 0.5). **PASS**.

### Cash Conversion

* **TTM FCF:** $1,260M / **TTM Net Income:** $1,552M  
* **Ratio:** $1,260 / 1,552 = **81.2%**. (Target: > 80%). **PASS**.

### The "Zero-Revenue" Survival

* **Liquidity (Cash + Securities):** $5,233M + $9.8M = **$5,242.8M**  
* **Annual OpEx:** $2,950M  
* **Math:** $5,242.8 / (2,950 / 12) = **21.3 months**  
*Copart can survive nearly 2 years without a single dollar of revenue.*

---

## STEP 4: MANAGEMENT & INTEGRITY

* **Capital Allocation:** Management prioritizes **(C) M&A/Organic Expansion** (purchasing land). They have remarkably **not** repurchased shares in the last 3 years, choosing to stockpile $5.2B in cash.  
* **Share Count Trend:** Diluted shares outstanding moved from 974M (2023) to 977M (2025). CAGR is ~0.15%. **PASS**.  
* **Compensation Alignment:** **INSUFFICIENT DATA**. Proxy filings tie bonuses to "Operating Income" (EBIT) and corporate goals, but do not explicitly mandate an ROIC hurdle for the cash bonus. **FAIL** (on strictness).

---

## STEP 5: DUAL-VALUATION ENGINE

A **Quality Multiple (M)** of 20x is assigned due to the irreplaceable land moat and dominant market share.

### **A. The Li Lu Ratio (ROTIC)**

$$
ROTIC = \frac{EBIT}{\text{Total Assets} - \text{Cash} - \text{Goodwill} - \text{NIBCL}}
$$

* **Denominator:** $10,581M - 5,243M - 519M - 763M = \mathbf{\$4,056M}$  
* **Result:** $1,721M / 4,056M = \mathbf{42.4\%}$ (Target: $>15\%$). PASS.

### **B. Calculation 1: Strict Valuation (3-Year Conservative)**

* **Strict EBIT (Avg 2023-2025):**  
  $(1,487 + 1,572 + 1,697) / 3 = \mathbf{\$1,585M}$  
* **Intrinsic Value:**  
  $(1,585 \times 20) + (5,243 - 104) = \mathbf{\$36,839M}$  
* **Strict Valuation Gap:**  
  $1 - \left(\frac{37,820}{36,839}\right) = \mathbf{-2.6\%}$

### **C. Calculation 2: Normalized Valuation (Current Power)**

* **Normalized EBIT (TTM):** **$1,721M**  
* **Intrinsic Value:**  
  $(1,721 \times 20) + 5,139 = \mathbf{\$39,559M}$  
* **Normalized Valuation Gap:**  
  $1 - \left(\frac{37,820}{39,559}\right) = \mathbf{4.4\%}$

---

## STEP 6: THE RED FLAG GAUNTLET

* **Declining ROIC:** No. ROTIC remains top-tier.  
* **Acquisition Spree:** No. Most acquisitions are small land/yard additions.  
* **Capital Intensity:**  
  $500M \text{ (Capex)} / 1,800M \text{ (OCF)} = 27\%$  
  **PASS**.  
* **Insider Activity:** Net selling by CEO Jeff Liaw noted in late 2025. **INSUFFICIENT DATA** on total % of holdings sold.

## FINAL REPORT OUTPUT

| **Ticker** | **Verdict** |
| --- | --- |
| **CPRT** | **HOLD** |

### **Summary Table:**

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Strict Valuation Gap** | **-2.6%** (Overvalued) |
| **Normalized Valuation Gap** | **4.4%** (Fair Value) |

---

## **The "Anti-Thesis":**

A smart person would sell because Copart is currently a "land-heavy bank" with $5.2B in idle cash yielding low returns compared to its core business, while trading at a premium multiple that leaves zero margin of safety for the eventual adoption of crash-prevention technology.

---

## **The "Fat Pitch" Condition:**

To achieve a **30% Strict Valuation Gap**, the market cap must fall to **$25.79B**, representing a stock price of approximately **$26.65**.

# Strict Li Lu Analysis Framework: Copart, Inc. [CPRT]

**OBJECTIVE:** Provide a definitive YES/NO/AVOID verdict based on the Li Lu value investing framework.

**DATA SOURCE:** Financials extracted from GuruFocus (Dec 2025), SEC 10-K (FY ended July 31, 2024), and 10-Q (Oct 31, 2024).

---

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS MOAT & COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### Core Business (One Sentence)

* Copart provides online auction and vehicle remarketing services for salvage and used vehicles, primarily for insurance companies.

### Durable Competitive Advantage - STRICT TEST

* **PASS:** Copart possesses a massive two-sided network effect (global buyer base + insurance supply) and a physical "moat" through its extensive ownership of licensed salvage land, which faces extreme zoning hurdles for new entrants.
* Does the company have pricing power? **YES.** It has consistently raised service fees and maintained margins despite competitive pressures.
* Is this moat widening, stable, or narrowing? **WIDENING.** Copart has steadily gained market share from its primary competitor, IAA (now RB Global), due to its superior technology and logistics network.

---

## SECTION 2: BUSINESS QUALITY & PREDICTABILITY

* Is the business model simple enough to forecast 10 years out? **YES.** Total loss rates and vehicle volumes are historically stable and predictable.
* Are revenues recurring or transactional? **TRANSACTIONAL** (but highly recurring due to the nature of insurance industry contracts).
* Cyclical or counter-cyclical? **COUNTER-CYCLICAL.** During recessions, demand for salvage parts and used cars typically increases as new car sales slow.
* **CRITICAL:** Can you forecast earnings 5-10 years with 80%+ confidence? **YES.**

---

## SECTION 3: FINANCIAL FORTRESS

* **Debt-to-Equity ratio:** **0.01** vs. industry average: **0.65** (Source: GuruFocus/Alpha Spread).
* **PASS:** D/E < 0.5 and stable/declining.
* Free Cash Flow positive? **YES.** Growing faster than earnings? **YES.** (FY2024 FCF ~$1.5B vs NI $1.36B).
* **Cash conversion rate (FCF/Net Income):** **110.3%** (Target: >80%).
* Can survive 50% revenue drop for 2 years? **YES.** With ~$3.7B in cash and virtually no debt, the company is a "fortress."

---

## SECTION 4: MANAGEMENT & INTEGRITY DUE DILIGENCE

### Management Team Assessment

* **CEO tenure:** Jeffrey Liaw (joined 2016, CEO since 2022). **Track record:** Exceptional; led international expansion and tech modernization.
* **Management changes (last 5 years):** Transition of Jay Adair to Executive Chairman; Leah Stearns appointed CFO. No suspicious departures.
* **Red flag:** Frequent C-suite turnover? **NO.**

### Integrity Check

* **SEC filings:** No restatements or auditor disputes reported in 2024 10-K. **YES.**
* **Insider trading:** Net **SELLING**. Key insiders (Adair, Liaw) have sold shares in late 2024/2025. This indicates a "caution" signal regarding price, though they retain massive holdings.
* **Management compensation:** Tied to performance-based equity and operating income targets.
* **Related-party transactions:** None that are suspicious. **NO.**

### Lawsuits & Legal Risk

* **Active lawsuits:** Standard operational litigation (contract disputes, property damage). No material litigation disclosed in latest 10-K Note 14.
* **Regulatory risk:** Subject to environmental and zoning regulations; no active federal investigations. **NO.**
* **Settlement history:** No major settlements exceeding 1% of revenue in the past 5 years.
* **Verdict:** Does legal risk threaten the business model? **NO.**

---

## SECTION 5: MARKET POSITION & SUSTAINABILITY

### Market Share & Competitive Position

* **Market share:** **~45%** (vs. top 3 competitors: RB Global/IAA ~35%, smaller regional players ~20%).
* **Trend:** **GAINING.** Gained ~300bps of share over the last 3 years (Source: Industry Data/10-K).
* **Market size (TAM):** ~$25B global salvage market. **Penetration:** ~17%.
* **Growth runway:** **YES.** International expansion (Germany, Spain, Brazil) provides a long runway.

### 10-Year Viability Test

* **Disruption risk:** Is the business threatened? **NO.** EV accidents result in higher total-loss rates due to battery costs, potentially benefiting Copart.
* **Customer concentration:** Top 10 customers < 30% of revenue. No single insurer poses an existential threat.
* **Supplier concentration:** Dependent on single supplier? **NO.**
* **Verdict:** Will this company exist and thrive in 10 years? **YES.**

---

## SECTION 6: VALUATION & MARGIN OF SAFETY

### Core Valuation Metrics

* **Intrinsic value (Alpha Spread Base Case):** **$28.10** (Source: Alpha Spread / GuruFocus DCF).
* **Current price:** **$39.32** (Retrieved Dec 2025).
* **Margin of safety:** **-39.9%** (Negative margin).
* **FAIL:** Margin of safety is < 20%.
* **P/E ratio:** **24.0x** vs. historical average: **28.5x** vs. peers: **21.2x**.
* **PEG ratio:** **1.8** (Target: <1.0).
* **EV/EBITDA:** **18.1x** (Target: <12x for fair value).
* **ROIC:** **30.5%** vs. cost of capital (WACC): **9.2%**. (Target: >15%).

### Li Lu Quality Ratios

* **Li Lu Ratio:** **41.8%** (EBIT ÷ Invested Capital)

**Verdict:** Li Lu Ratio of **41.8%** vs cost of capital **9.2%**. Moat strength: **STRONG.**

---

## SECTION 7: GROWTH & RETURNS

* **Revenue growth (3-year CAGR):** **11.2%** vs. industry: **7.4%**.
* **ROE:** **20.8%** vs. cost of capital: **9.2%**. (PASS).
* **EPS growth (3-year CAGR):** **13.5%** vs. stock price growth: **15.2%**.
* **Capital efficiency:** **YES.** Can grow without proportional capital increases due to digital auction model.

---

## SECTION 8: RED FLAGS - AUTOMATIC AVOID

* [ ] Competitive advantage eroding: **FALSE**
* [ ] Margins declining: **FALSE**
* [ ] Debt rising while cash flow declining: **FALSE**
* [ ] Insiders selling heavily: **TRUE** (Net selling by Liaw and Adair in late 2024/2025)
* [ ] Technological disruption threat: **FALSE**
* [ ] Single customer dependency (>30%): **FALSE**
* [ ] Poor capital allocation: **FALSE**
* [ ] Management integrity issues: **FALSE**
* [ ] Active material lawsuits: **FALSE**
* [x] **Margin of safety < 20%:** **TRUE** (The stock is currently trading at a premium to intrinsic value).

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**Is this a Li Lu-style value buy?**

### **NO**

(Condition Failed: Reasonable valuation / Margin of Safety).

### **AVOID**

(Reason: **Margin of safety < 20%**. While Copart is a world-class "business quality" play, it fails the "value" requirement of the Li Lu framework at current prices).

---

## INVESTMENT THESIS

Copart is a high-quality compounder with a dominant moat, exceptional ROIC (41.8% Li Lu Ratio), and a debt-free balance sheet. However, the current market price of ~$39 implies a significant premium over its intrinsic value of ~$28, providing no margin of safety for a value investor.

---

## MOAT ASSESSMENT

* **Type:** Network Effects & Scale/Zoning Cost Advantage.
* **Durability:** **Strong**
* **Trend:** **Widening**
* **Evidence:** Operating margins of 37% and ROIC >30% sustained over a decade.

---

## RISK/REWARD

* **Upside (5-10 years):** **~100%** (Projected earnings growth of 12% CAGR).
* **Downside (if thesis breaks):** **~35%** (Reversion to intrinsic value of $28).
* **Ratio:** **2.8:1** (Close to target but hindered by entry price).

---

## ACTION

**AVOID**
The business is magnificent, but the price is prohibitive; wait for a correction to <$30 to achieve a sufficient margin of safety.
