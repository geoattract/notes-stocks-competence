Subject: Forensic Deep-Dive: Depo Auto Parts Industrial Co., Ltd. (6605.TW)

The following audit of Depo Auto Parts Industrial Co., Ltd. (6605.TW) has been conducted under the "Himalaya Forensic Protocol." Our default posture remains cynical: management is a temporary steward, and the balance sheet is a crime scene until proven otherwise.

---

### SECTION 1: PRE-QUALIFICATION (THE "TOO HARD" PILE)

**Lindy Effect Audit:** Depo has manufactured auto lighting since 1977. The "core revenue engine"—selling replacement headlights for broken cars—is as physically certain as entropy itself. It is fundamentally immune to temporal decay because as long as humans drive physical cars and crash them, they will need lamps.

* **Business Simplicity:** YES. They make lights for cars. When a light breaks, they sell a new one.
* **Historical Profitability:** YES. Net Income has been positive every year from 2020 to 2024, growing from NT3.156B.
* **Circle of Competence:** YES. Physical goods with trackable unit economics in the automotive aftermarket.

### SECTION 2: THE MOAT & PRICING POWER

**Metabolic Cost of Entry:** A competitor must replicate 40+ years of mold engineering and global distribution networks. The "Metabolic Cost" is the billions in R&D and tooling required to match Depo's SKU library (ACURA to VOLVO).

* **Moat Type:** **Cost Advantage & Scale.** Depo leverages massive manufacturing scale in Taiwan to dominate the "AM" (Aftermarket) segment.
* **The "10% Test" (Gross Margin):** **Expanding.** * 2021: 27.43%
* 2022: 29.63%
* 2023: 31.73%
* 2024: 34.07%.
* *Forensic Note:* A 664 bps expansion in 4 years during a global supply chain crisis suggests intense pricing power or massive internal efficiency gains.


* **Inflation Resilience:** YES. Aftermarket parts are "non-discretionary" repairs; customers pay or don't drive.
* **Switching Cost:** **Psychological/Reliability.** Mechanics and distributors rely on Depo's "CAPA" certifications; switching to uncertified "no-name" parts carries high liability risk.

### SECTION 3: THE LI LU RATIO (ROTIC)

We ignore the NT$4.04B in "lazy" cash to see how hard the actual machines are working.

**Target: >20% Sustained.**

**The Formula:** 

* **[A] EBIT (2024):** NT373.87M (Interest) = **NT$4,444.76M**.
* **[B] Total Assets:** **NT$32,977.27M**.
* **[C] Excess Cash:** Cash (NT1,007.8M) = **NT$3,038.01M**.
* **[D] NIBCL:** Total Current Liab (NT3,682.02M) = **NT$5,346.99M**.
* **[E] Intangibles:** **NT$121.28M** (Assume minimal based on NTA/BV proximity).

**Calculation:** .
*Note: This narrowly misses the 20% target but is exceptional for a capital-intensive manufacturer.*

**Incremental ROIC (24 Month):**
.
*Management is deploying new capital with lethal efficiency.*

### SECTION 4: FINANCIAL FORTRESS (SURVIVAL)

* **Solvency:** D/E Ratio is **0.25**, well below the 0.50 limit.
* **Interest Coverage:** **11.0x** (EBIT/Interest).
* **Nuclear Winter Buffer:** Cash (NT2.95B) = **1.37 Years**.
* *Verdict:* They can keep the lights on for over a year with zero sales.



### SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT INTEGRITY & CAPITAL ALLOCATION

* **Share Count Trend:** Stable. 165.8M shares (2020) to 167.7M (2024). Dilution is <0.5% CAGR. **PASS.**
* **SBC Leakage:** Negligible. Taiwan firms rarely use US-style heavy SBC options.
* **Capital Allocation:** 66% Payout Ratio. They are returning most "excess" cash to shareholders via dividends (NT$9.00/share) while maintaining organic growth.

### SECTION 6: CASH FLOW INTEGRITY

* **Cash Conversion:** OCF (NT2.28B) = **2.19**.
* *Forensic Alert:* This is a "Golden Ratio." Cash flow is double reported profit, suggesting conservative accounting or massive depreciation tailwinds.


* **CapEx Intensity:** CapEx (NT5.01B) = **5.8%**.
* *Verdict:* This is a **CASH COW**, not a treadmill. They spend almost nothing to maintain their empire.



### SECTION 7: FORENSIC JOCKEY & CULTURAL AUDIT

**Founder DNA:** Founded by the current CEO in 1977. This is a "Missionary" firm. The pivot from a 2-person trading shop to a global lighting leader required decades of "Owner-Operator" patience.

**Succession:** The board remains heavily influenced by the founder's lineage (Xie family). While this risks "Nepotistic Fragility," the 40-year track record suggests "Owner Stability."

### SECTION 8: ASSET VALUATION & PRICE-DECOMPOSITION

* **NTA Floor:** (Total Assets NT13.0B) / 165.8M = **NT$120.00**.
* **The Price Decomposition (at NT$139.50):**
1. **Cash Component:** NT24.36**.
2. **Hard Asset Component (PPE):** NT74.18**.


* **The "Business Premium":** .
* **The "Steal" Test:** You are paying only **NT$40.96** for a business that generates **NT$18.98** in EPS. You are buying the "Moat" for ~2.1 years of earnings. **THIS IS A STEAL.**

### SECTION 9: THE DUAL-VALUATION ENGINE

* **A. Strict Valuation (K=10x):** Avg Profit (NT144.75**.
* **B. Normalized Owner Earnings (K=12x):** (NT2.1B Depr - NT354.00**.

### SECTION 10: THE RED FLAG GAUNTLET

* **Declining ROIC:** NO. ROA and ROE are at 5-year highs.
* **Acquisition Spree:** NO. Growth is primarily organic.
* **The Kodak Test:** **LED/Smart Lighting Transition.** If Depo fails to master complex LED/Sensor integration, they become a "commodity plastic" maker. However, current margins suggest they are leading this transition.

### SECTION 11: THE LAYMAN’S BLINDSPOT

* **Inventory Aging:** Inventory NT20.1B. Turnover is ~3x. Not "stuffing" the channel.
* **Customer Concentration:** High. 58% of shares held by retail/public, but manufacturing is global. Losing a major US distributor like Advance Auto Parts would be a "Single Point of Failure."

### SECTION 12: THE LEGENDS' ROUNDTABLE

**Li Lu:** "Warren, look at the NTA floor. We're buying hard Taiwan manufacturing assets at almost book value, and getting a 18% ROTIC engine for free. The incremental ROIC of 80% tells me they've found a way to digitize their mold-making. This is a classic 'modern value' play in an unglamorous sector."

**Buffett:** "I like the lights, Li. People crash cars in good times and bad. The expansion in gross margins from 27% to 34% tells me the 'fence' is getting higher. They aren't just selling plastic; they're selling 'reliability' to a guy under a car who doesn't want to do the job twice."

**Munger:** "It's a clean machine. No SBC slop. High cash conversion. The 'Lazy Cash' is a bit annoying, but I'd rather have it in the bank than spent on a foolish vanity acquisition. It's a 'cannibal' waiting to happen if they ever decide to buy back shares aggressively."

**VERDICT: BUY (Fat Pitch Territory)**

### FINAL REPORT OUTPUT

| Metric | Value | Audit Citation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current Price | **NT$139.50** | Market Data |
| NTA Floor (Liquidation) | **NT$120.00** | [Section 8] |
| ROTIC | **18.16%** | [Section 3] |
| Cash & Assets / Share | **NT$98.54** | [Section 8] |
| Business Premium Paid | **NT$40.96** | [Section 8] |
| Strict Intrinsic Price | **NT$144.75** | [Section 9] |
| Margin of Safety | **3.6% (Strict) / 60% (Owner Earn)** | [Section 9] |

**The "Anti-Thesis":** A rapid shift to "modular" vehicle front-ends could allow OEMs to lock out aftermarket lamp makers via proprietary software "handshakes" (Data Lock-in), destroying Depo's 34% margins overnight.

**The "Fat Pitch" Condition:** A price of **NT$72.00** would represent a 50% gap to the *Strict* valuation, though it currently trades at a 60% discount to *Owner Earnings*.

**Recommendation:** Depo is an "Inevitability." It is a high-quality, low-capex compounder disguised as a boring industrial. At NT$139.50, you are essentially buying the physical assets and getting the world-class brand and engineering for a pittance..
