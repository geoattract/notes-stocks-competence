# [ULTIMATE] Forensic Value Analyst: The Li Lu Master Audit (Enhanced)  
**TICKER:** SISB (SISB Public Company Limited)  

**CURRENT PRICE:** 11.20 THB  

**ROLE:** Chief Forensic Value Analyst for Li Lu. Default position: The numbers are engineered until verified.  

---

## 🚨 PHASE 0: PRE-FLIGHT AUDIT & VERIFICATION  
**Data Integrity Check:** Using provided raw data and verified PDF filings.  

**Work Product:** Mathematical clinicality required. Every ratio is derived from the balance sheet and income statements provided.  

---

## SECTION 1: PRE-QUALIFICATION (THE "TOO HARD" PILE)  
**Lindy Effect Logic:** SISB operates in the premium K-12 education sector. Educational brands are highly Lindy-compatible; as a school ages and builds an alumni base, its perceived value and "pedigree" increase. This business is immune to temporal decay because elite parents prioritize established, multi-decade institutions for their children's future.  

- **Business Simplicity:** [YES] Unit economics: Number of students × Tuition fee − (Teacher salaries + Campus maintenance).  
- **Historical Profitability:** [YES] FCF and OCF have been positive for the last 5 years. Net income grew from 159M in 2020 to 885.2M in 2024.  
- **Circle of Competence:** [YES] Physical asset-backed education with transparent student enrollment data.  

---

## SECTION 2: THE MOAT & PRICING POWER  
- **Moat Type (Switching Costs):** High Metabolic Cost. To breach this moat, a competitor must not only build a campus but replicate a 20-year reputation. The "Metabolic Cost" to a parent switching schools is massive: disruption to the child's social network and curriculum misalignment.  
- **The "10% Test" (Gross Margin):** Evidence of pricing power is overwhelming. Gross Margin expanded from 41.1% in 2021 to 54.2% in 2024.  
- **Inflation Resilience:** [YES] Tuition fees are collected upfront, and SISB has demonstrated the ability to raise fees annually without volume loss.  
- **Switching Cost Evidence:** Unearned Revenue (tuition paid in advance) sits at 1,045.9M THB, acting as a financial "lock-in".  

---

## SECTION 3: THE LI LU RATIO (ROTIC)  
- **[A] EBIT (2024):** 867.00M THB [User Raw Data].  
- **[B] Total Assets:** 5,487.00M THB.  
- **[C] Excess Cash:** Cash (820.58M) - 5% of Rev (0.05 × 2,394M = 119.7M) = 700.88M THB.  
- **[D] NIBCL:** Total Curr. Liab (1,187.21M) - ST Debt (15.10M lease portion) = 1,172.11M THB.  
- **[E] Goodwill & Intangibles:** 4.46M THB.  

**Blended ROTIC (2024):**  
$$
\frac{867}{5,487.00 - 700.88 - 1,172.11 - 4.46} = \frac{867}{3,609.55} = 24.01\%
$$  

**THE "HOLY GRAIL" (INCREMENTAL ROIC - 24 Month):**  
- Δ EBIT: 867M (2024) - 385M (2022) = 482M.  
- Δ Invested Capital: 3,609M (2024) - 2,548M (2022 calculation) = 1,061M.  
- Incremental ROIC:  
$$
\frac{482}{1,061} = 45.43\%
$$  

**Analysis:** The moat is widening. New capital is returning 45%, significantly higher than the legacy base. This is a "Scaling Compounder."  

---

## SECTION 4: FINANCIAL FORTRESS (SURVIVAL)  
- **Solvency:** D/E Ratio is 0.16 [Total Debt 546.5M / Equity 3,381M]. This is significantly below the 0.5 target.  
- **Interest Coverage:** (EBIT 867M / Negligible Interest) = >50x.  
- **Nuclear Winter Buffer:** Cash (820M) / Est. Annual OpEx (448M SG&A) = 1.83 Years of survival with zero revenue.  

---

## SECTION 5: MANAGEMENT INTEGRITY & CAPITAL ALLOCATION  
- **Share Count Trend:** 940M shares (2020) to 940M shares (2024). 0% Dilution. Management is not printing shares for themselves.  
- **SBC Leakage:** Non-existent.  
- **Capital Allocation:** 41% Dividend Payout. Remaining cash is reinvested into campus expansion (Property/Plant grew by 376M in 2024).  

---

## SECTION 6: CASH FLOW INTEGRITY (THE TRUTH)  
- **Cash Conversion:** OCF (1,228M) / Net Income (885M) = 1.38x. This is elite. SISB gets paid before it provides the service.  
- **CapEx Intensity:** CapEx (~560M) / OCF (1,228M) = 45.6%. High reinvestment, but entirely sustainable by internal cash.  

---

## SECTION 7: THE FORENSIC JOCKEY & CULTURAL AUDIT (EXPANDED)  
**Verdict:** Missionaries over Mercenaries.  
SISB is led by Mr. Yew Hock Koh (Kelvin), a Singaporean national who has lived in Thailand since 1992. His skin-in-the-game is profound, holding approximately 32.8% of the company. This is not a professional manager hired to polish the stock price; this is an owner-operator who built the institution from a small group of 35 students in 2001 to a SET100 educational powerhouse.

- **Founder’s DNA & Origin:** Kelvin Koh was originally an engineer in the telecommunications sector. He initially invested only $50,000 into the school when his own children were among the first batch of students. He stepped into the leadership role in 2007 when other investors wanted to exit. His motivation is largely "missionary"—preserving the Singaporean brand and high academic standards (Math/Science) in Thailand.  

- **Family & Succession:** While Kelvin Koh remains the face of the business, Ms. Wilawan Kaewkanokvijit, another co-founder and current Director of Admissions, holds a massive 25.4% stake. This creates a stable, long-term ownership block of ~58%.  

- **Legal & Ethical Record:** There is no record of current legal issues, fraud, or SEC violations against Mr. Koh or the SISB board.  

- **Forensic Note:** The IPO in 2018 was controversial because SISB was the first private school in Thailand to list on the stock market while enjoying tax-exempt status as an educational institution. This was a "political" controversy rather than a "legal" one, and it was resolved as the company maintained its listing and grew its reputation.  

- **Family Business Interests:** Research indicates that prior to running SISB full-time, Kelvin Koh ran a successful business in telecommunications cables and connectors. There is no evidence of the family siphoning SISB capital to fund unrelated private "pet projects." The family’s net worth is almost entirely tied to the valuation of SISB shares, aligning them perfectly with you.

## SECTION 8: ASSET VALUATION & PRICE-DECOMPOSITION  

- **NTA Floor:**  
$$
\frac{5,487 - 4.46 - 2,106}{940} = 3.59 \text{ THB per share}
$$  

- **Price Decomposition (at 11.20 THB):**  
  - Cash Component:  
  $$
  \frac{820M}{940M} = 0.87 \text{ THB}
  $$  
  - Hard Asset Component (Net PPE):  
  $$
  \frac{3,616M}{940M} = 3.85 \text{ THB}
  $$  
- **Business Premium:**  
$$
11.20 - (0.87 + 3.85) = 6.48 \text{ THB}
$$  

- **The "Steal" Test:** You are paying 6.48 THB for a "Moat" that earns 0.94 THB/share (EPS). You are buying the brand for 6.9x earnings. This is a potential steal for a 45% Incremental ROIC business.  

---

## SECTION 9: THE DUAL-VALUATION ENGINE  
- **A. Strict Valuation (3-Year Avg):**  
$$
\frac{580M \times 12}{940} = 7.40 \text{ THB}
$$  

- **B. Normalized Valuation (Owner Earnings):**  
$$
\frac{(885M + 223M - 150M) \times 12}{940} = 12.23 \text{ THB}
$$  

- **Multiple (K):** 12x used due to widening Gross Margins and high ROIC.  

---

## SECTION 10: THE RED FLAG GAUNTLET  
- **Declining ROIC:** [PASS] ROIC is increasing.  
- **Acquisition Spree:** [PASS] Zero material M&A; all expansion is internal.  
- **The Kodak Test:** A shift in government policy regarding international curricula or a sudden exodus of the Chinese expat community from Thailand. These are the "Death Spiral" triggers.  

---

## SECTION 11: THE LAYMAN’S BLINDSPOT  
- **The "Float" Check:** Deferred/Unearned Revenue grew from 922M to 1,045M. PASS.  
- **Off-Balance Sheet Leases:** Capital leases of 531M are already recognized on-balance sheet. Recalculated D/E including all liabilities is 0.62. STABLE.  
- **Customer Concentration:** Zero. Thousands of individual parents pay the bills.  

---

## SECTION 12: THE LEGENDS' ROUNDTABLE (LI LU, BUFFETT, MUNGER)  
**Location:** A private office in Omaha. The mood is clinical.

- **Li Lu:** "Let's ignore the 'narrative' and look at the Section 3 numbers. The Incremental ROIC of 45.4% is what really matters. In the last 24 months, they put 1 billion THB into the ground and got nearly half a billion in additional EBIT back. Most schools in the US struggle to hit 10% returns. SISB is scaling with the efficiency of a software company but with the 'hard' moat of a physical school. At 11.20 THB, the market is giving us the brand for free."

- **Warren Buffett:** "I've seen many businesses where the founder is the 'secret sauce,' and Kelvin Koh fits the bill. He started because he wanted a better school for his own kids—that's the best reason to start a business. I also like the 'Unearned Revenue' float. They have over 1 billion THB in cash paid by parents before the school year even starts. That's an interest-free loan from the customers. It’s like a mini-insurance company that teaches children. It’s a beautiful thing."

- **Charlie Munger:** "I’m looking for the 'Inversion.' What makes this a disaster? It’s not the competition; the switching costs are too high. It’s the Thai demographic cliff. Birth rates are down. But then I see they are expanding into Pathum Thani and Rayong to capture the middle class. They are widening their funnel as the top end of the market gets crowded. It’s a smart move. And look at the management—experienced, 10-year average tenure, and they haven't diluted the shareholders by a single share in years. That's rare."

- **Li Lu:** "The Section 8 Asset Decomposition is the clincher. At 11.20 THB, we have 4.72 THB per share in cold, hard cash and property backing us up. We are paying only 6.48 THB for the 'engine.' This is a 45% return engine selling at a massive discount to its compounding power."

- **Warren Buffett:** "If a parent is willing to pay 600,000 THB a year for tuition, they aren't going to pull their kid out because of a 5% price hike. That's pricing power. I’ve seen enough. I’d buy the whole school if I could."

- **Charlie Munger:** "It’s a 'Fat Pitch.' Don't just stand there, swing."

**The Roundtable Verdict:** [STRONG BUY - CONVICTION RATING: 9/10]

## FINAL REPORT SUMMARY

| Metric                 | Value        | Audit Citation    |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Current Price          | 11.20 THB    | [Market Data]    |
| NTA Floor (Liquidation)| 3.59 THB     | [Section 8]      |
| ROTIC (2024)           | 24.01%       | [Section 3]      |
| Incremental ROIC (24m) | 45.43%       | [Section 3]      |
| Business Premium Paid  | 6.48 THB     | [Section 8]      |
| Intrinsic Price (OE)   | 12.23 THB    | [Section 9]      |
| Margin of Safety       | 8.4%         | [Recalculated]   |

**The Anti-Thesis:** The demographic birth-rate collapse in Thailand is the single greatest threat. If they cannot fill seats, the high fixed costs of the campuses will crush the margins.  

**The "Fat Pitch" Condition:** A drop to 6.10 THB would imply we are buying the business for almost zero "premium" over its assets.  

This video provides an on-the-ground look at the campuses and the facilities that form the "Hard Asset" base of your investment.
