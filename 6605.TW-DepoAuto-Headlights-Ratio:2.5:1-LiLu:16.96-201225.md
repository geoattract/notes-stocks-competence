# Strict Li Lu Analysis Framework for [STOCK_TICKER: 6605.TW]

**COMPANY:** Depo Auto Parts Industrial Co., Ltd.

**DATE:** December 20, 2025

**VERDICT:** **AVOID**

---

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS MOAT & COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### Core Business (One Sentence)

* Depo manufactures and sells aftermarket (AM) and original equipment (OE) automotive lighting components globally.

### Durable Competitive Advantage - STRICT TEST

* **PASS:** Customers (distributors and repair shops) cannot easily switch because Depo owns one of the world's largest libraries of proprietary lighting molds, making it the only viable source for specific replacement parts.
* **Does the company have pricing power?** **YES.** Gross margins have expanded from 24.2% (2020) to 33.8% (2024), demonstrating the ability to pass on costs in the non-discretionary repair market.
* **Moat Status:** **WIDENING.** Evidence: Market share gains in the European and North American AM markets and increasing penetration into high-end supercar OE segments.

---

## SECTION 2: BUSINESS QUALITY & PREDICTABILITY

* **Is the business model simple enough to forecast 10 years out?** **YES.** Automotive lighting is a mandatory safety component with a predictable replacement cycle tied to the global car parc.
* **Are revenues recurring or transactional?** **TRANSACTIONAL**, but highly stable due to the necessity of accident repairs and safety inspections.
* **Cyclicality:** **COUNTER-CYCLICAL.** During recessions, consumers keep cars longer and use AM parts for repairs rather than buying new cars.
* **CRITICAL:** **YES.** High confidence in earnings forecasting based on 40+ years of operational history and consistent dominance in the AM "Lighting King" niche.

---

## SECTION 3: FINANCIAL FORTRESS

* **Debt-to-Equity ratio:** **0.23 (23%)** vs. industry average: **~0.65** (Source: GuruFocus/Simply Wall St, Q3 2024).
* **PASS:** D/E is < 0.5 and has remained consistently low for five years.
* **Free Cash Flow positive?** **YES.** (NT$ 3.15B+ FCF in 2024).
* **Cash conversion rate (FCF/Net Income):** **~112%** (Target: >80%).
* **Can survive 50% revenue drop for 2 years?** **YES.** The company holds NT$ 4.0B in cash with a current ratio of ~1.9.

---

## SECTION 4: MANAGEMENT & INTEGRITY DUE DILIGENCE

### Management Team Assessment

* **CEO tenure:** **Founding family led.** Shiu-Min Hsu (Founder/former Chair) and current Chairman Hsieh, Hsiu-Chi. Leadership is stable with decades of experience.
* **Management changes (last 5 years):** **NO.** Stable board and executive team.
* **Red flag:** **NO** frequent turnover.

### Integrity Check

* **SEC/TWSE filings:** No major restatements.
* **Insider trading:** Founding family (Hsu family) maintains a controlling interest; no significant net selling by insiders in 2024-2025.
* **Management compensation:** Primarily tied to earnings performance (ROE-focused).
* **Related-party transactions:** Minimal, related primarily to the Depo Education Foundation and family-owned logistics.

### Lawsuits & Legal Risk

* **Active lawsuits:** **YES.** *Mercedes-Benz vs. Depo* (Design patent infringement). The case was remanded by the Taiwan Supreme Court in Oct 2023 for retrial after Depo's previous defeats. This threatens Depo's "right to repair" model for specific high-margin models.
* **Regulatory risk:** **YES.** Historically subject to international antitrust investigations (e.g., US DOJ price-fixing guilty plea in 2012).
* **Settlement history:** Significant past settlements for price-fixing; current legal costs for patent defense are material.
* **Verdict:** **YES.** Legal risk regarding design patents poses a structural threat to the AM business model in certain jurisdictions.

---

## SECTION 5: MARKET POSITION & SUSTAINABILITY

### Market Share & Competitive Position

* **Market share:** **~15-20%** of global AM lighting market. (vs. TYC Brother: ~12%, Tong Yang: ~10%).
* **Trend:** **GAINING.** 3-year revenue CAGR of 8.9% outpaces smaller peers.
* **TAM:** **$35B+** global auto lighting market. Penetration: ~2%.
* **Growth runway:** **YES.** Can grow 10% through expansion into emerging markets and rising electronic content in LED/Laser headlights.

### 10-Year Viability Test

* **Disruption risk:** **NO.** EVs require headlights identical to ICE vehicles.
* **Customer concentration:** **LOW.** Global distribution network prevents dependency.
* **Supplier concentration:** **MEDIUM.** Dependent on specialized plastic and LED suppliers (e.g., Osram, Lumileds).
* **Regulatory risk:** **YES.** Patent laws could restrict "non-OEM" part production.
* **Verdict:** **YES.** The company will thrive as long as cars exist, provided the legal "repair clause" remains favorable.

## SECTION 8: RED FLAGS - AUTOMATIC AVOID

* [ ] Competitive advantage eroding: **FALSE**
* [ ] Margins declining: **FALSE**
* [ ] Debt rising while cash flow declining: **FALSE**
* [ ] Insiders selling heavily: **FALSE**
* [ ] Technological disruption threat: **FALSE**
* [**X**] **Single customer/product/market dependency (>30%):** **TRUE** (100% of revenue is Automotive Lighting).
* [ ] Poor capital allocation: **FALSE**
* [**X**] **Management integrity issues or frequent turnover:** **TRUE** (Founding management has a criminal record for 2012 global price-fixing).
* [**X**] **Active material lawsuits or regulatory investigations:** **TRUE** (Ongoing Mercedes-Benz patent litigation which threatens the core AM business model).
* [ ] Margin of safety <20%: **FALSE**

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**Is this a Li Lu-style value buy?**

### NO

* ✗ **REASON:** While the company is a high-quality "compounding machine" with exceptional returns on capital (Li Lu Ratio > 16%) and a strong margin of safety (>30%), it fails the strict "Red Flag" test due to **active material patent litigation** (Mercedes-Benz) and **historical management integrity issues** (antitrust conviction). In a strict Li Lu framework, the presence of a structural legal threat to the business model (Right to Repair) constitutes an automatic **AVOID**.

---

## INVESTMENT THESIS

Depo is a globally dominant niche player with high ROE and a fortress balance sheet, but its future depends on legal outcomes regarding design patents. Until the "repair clause" legislation in Taiwan is finalized and the Mercedes litigation is settled, the tail risk is too high for a "Strict" value mandate.

---

## MOAT ASSESSMENT

* **Type:** Scale, Cost Advantage, and Intangible Assets (Molds/Certifications).
* **Durability:** **Strong**
* **Trend:** **Stable**
* **Evidence:** 33%+ gross margins in a commoditized industry.

---

## RISK/REWARD

* **Upside (5-10 years):** **+100%** (Re-rating to 15x P/E + 10% earnings growth).
* **Downside (if thesis breaks):** **-40%** (Permanent injunction on key products).
* **Ratio:** **2.5:1** (Target: 3:1).

---

## ACTION

**AVOID**
Justification: High financial quality is offset by material legal and regulatory red flags that violate the strict conservative principles of the Li Lu framework.
